### Miscellaneous

- ISHII (石井) is a popular surname in Japan. Shun is also common, but the corresponding Chinese character (竣) is rarely used for names. Please be careful when citing my name, since there are many similar-looking Chinese characters...

- Other than mathematics, I enjoy reading books, hiking in mountains and taking photos of wildflowers. You can find some of my favorite books at [this page](/books), and some photos [here](/photos) (the page won't open since the photo files are large).

- under construction
