### Miscellaneous

- ISHII (石井) is a popular surname in Japan. Shun is also common, but the corresponding Chinese character (竣) is rarely used for names. The only example I know of this character being used in everyday language is the word 竣工 (or 竣成). Please be careful when citing my name, since there are many similar-looking Chinese characters...

- Other than mathematics, I enjoy reading books, hiking in mountains and taking photos of wildflowers. You can find some of my favorite books at [this page](/books), and some photos [here](/photos) (**Warning!** the page won't open since the photo files are too large).
